# Personal Ansible Configs


## Disclaimer
This repository contains a copy of the Ansible configuration that I use for laptops, desktops as well as servers.

The folder structure breaks down like this:

**local.yml**: This is the Playbook that Ansible expects to find by default in pull-mode, think of it as an "index" of sorts that pulls other Playbooks in.


**ansible.cfg**: Configuration settings for Ansible goes here.


**group_vars/**: This directory is where I can place variables that will be applied on every system.


**host_vars/**: Each laptop/desktop/server gets a host_vars file in this folder, named after its hostname. Sets variables specific to that computer.


**hosts**: This is the inventory file. Even in pull-mode, an inventory file can be used. This is how Ansible knows what group to put a machine in.


**playbooks**: Additional playbooks that I may want to run, or have triggered.


**roles/**: This directory contains my base, workstation, and server roles. Every host gets the base role. Then either 'workstation' or 'server', depending on what it is.

**roles/base**: This role is for every host, regardles of the type of device it is. This role contains things that are intended to be on every host, such as default configs, users, etc.

**roles/workstation**: After the base role runs on a host, this role runs only on hosts that are designated to be workstations. GUI-specific things, such as GUI apps (Firefox, etc), Flatpaks, wallpaper, etc. Has a folder for the GNOME and MATE desktops.

**roles/server**: After the base role runs on a host, this role runs only on hosts designated as servers. Monitoring plugins, unattended-updates, server firewall rules, and other server-related things are configured here.
